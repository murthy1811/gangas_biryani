- #### **Back-end**
    * **[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)** - a lightweight micro web framework written in Python used to create a simple,
        clean code and to reduce development time.
         user passwords to authenticate users.

### Issues and Solutions
* While adding the Reviews model, several issues popped due to the python code errors. Each error is fixed by carefully studying-
* Bootstrap classes implementation went hard in order to maintain the right flow
* Review page showed internal server error after deployment to heroku. Identified djago package error which I wrote into code and fixed
* Review page css fixed for all smaller screens to adjsut the page overall.


## Deployment

- #### **Requirements:**
    * **Python3** to write the code and run the application
    * **PIP** to install packages
    * **Git** for version control
    * **GitPod** powered by VS Code was used for this project (any IDE of your choice will work)
    * **Django** - to create the models
    * **Heroku** - to deploy and manage the app


### Project Creation

* This project was created using the CI recommended [Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
* Click on **_Use this template_** button and enter a short and memorable name of your choice for your repo and select **_Create repository from template_**. 
* Once created, click on green **_Gitpod_** button to open your new workspace. 

 	1.  Log in to your  Gitpod account 
	2.  Clone this project repository from GitHub
    -   Go to my [LuucentCavern repository](https://github.com/murthy1811/gangas_biryani) 
 	3. Add Gitpod browser extension for Chrome:
    -   Go to  [GitPod Chrome Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki)
  	4.  If you  installed the extension you should view a green Gitpod button on the top right corner of page. Next to Clone or Download button. 
  	5. When clicked this button will allow you to open this repository directly in Gitpod.
	6.  The following environment variables needs to be set:

		KEY | VALUE
		------------- | ------------- | 
		DATABASE_URL | <DATABASE_URL>
		AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
		AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
		EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD | <EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD>
		EMAIL_HOST_USER | <EMAIL_HOST_USER>
		SECRET_KEY | <SECRET_KEY>
		STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | <STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>
		STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | <STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
		STRIPE_WH_SECRET | <STRIPE_WH_SECRET>
		USE_AWS | True

7.  Download all the dependencies to run this project and listed in the  **requirements.txt**  by running command **pip3 install -r requirement.txt**.
8.  Create a local development server. In the workspace run the following command  **python3 manage.py runserver** . Now you should have a Gitpod link to the deployed app.
</details>

### Deployment to Heroku
Heroku cloud platform was used to deploy and host this app by following the steps below:

* **Set up workspace for Heroku:** 
    * In the terminal window of your IDE, create a requirements.txt file to contain all applications and dependencies required to run the app.

        ``` pip3 freeze --local . requirements.txt```
    * Create a Procfile (always with a capital P and no file extension!) - required by Heroku, to know which file runs the app.

        ``` echo web: python app.py > Procfile```

* **Create application in Heroku:**
    * Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) website and create an account.
    * Once logged in, click on the **_New_** button and select **_Create New App_**
    * Create a name for your app and select the region closest to your location.

* **Connect your app to GitHub repository:**
    * On the **_Deploy_** page, select GitHub as your **_Deplyment method_**.
    * You will then be prompted to find the github repository, click on **_Connect_** button to connect.
    * Click on the **_Settings_** tab and and select **_Config Vars_** and **_Reveal Config Vars_**.
    * Add the following variables (as stored in env.py):

    ```
    os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
    os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
    os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "paste_your_secret_key_from_env.py")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "obtained_from_your MongoDB_account")
    os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "your_db_name")
    ```
    * In the IDE terminal, push the two new files to the GitHub repository:
    ```
    git add requirements.txt
    git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"        
    ```
    ``` 
    git add Procfile
    git commit -m "Add Procfile"
    git push
    ```
* Now go back to Heroku and click on **_Enable Automatic Deployment_** and **_Deploy Branch_**.
* The app is now connected and Heroku will receive the code from GitHub and automatically update whenever we push changes to the GitHub repository. You should be able to see "Your app was successfully deployed!". Click on **_View_** to launch your app.


### Clone the project
Steps required to **_Clone_** a repository from GitHub to your local machine:
* Navigate to the repository in GitHub.
* Click on the **_Code_** dropdown menu button.
* Click on **_Open with GitHub Desktop_** and follow the prompts to complete the cloning process.

### Fork the project
* To create a personal copy of this repository, click on **_Fork_** button on the top right corner of the repository page in GitHub.


### Run Locally
To run this project on your device using the IDE of your choice follow these steps:
* Install the requirements by typing in your IDE: 

1. Install **gunicorn** to run the application on Heroku by running command **sudo pip3 install gunicorn**
2. Install **pycopg2** to connect to PostgreSQL by running command  **sudo pip3 install psycopg2**
3. Create a **requirements.txt** file by running command **sudo pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt**
4. Create a new Heroku application by clicking **New** after **Create New App**. Give a name to your app and click **Create app**
5. Install PostgreSQL add-on by running command **heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev**
6. Create a Procfile by running command **echo web: gunicorn lucent-cavern.wsgi:application > Procfile**
7. Following config variables needs to be set:

KEY | VALUE
------------- | ------------- | 
DATABASE_URL | <DATABASE_URL>
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD | <EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD>
EMAIL_HOST_USER | <EMAIL_HOST_USER>
SECRET_KEY | <SECRET_KEY>
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | <STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | <STRIPE_SECRET_KEY>
STRIPE_WH_SECRET | <STRIPE_WH_SECRET>
USE_AWS | True

* In your IDE terminal, create the environment variables:   
    * Type ```touch env.py``` 
    in the terminal to create the file in the root directory. This file is used to store sensitive data (see environment variables above) and should never be pushed to GitHub.
    * To ignore it, create .gitignore file by typing 

    ```touch .gitignore``` 

    and add env.py into this file.
* You can now run the app, just type in the IDE terminal: 

    ```python3 app.py```.
