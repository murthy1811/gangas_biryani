    * **GitHub** - used as a hosting service and for future collaborations.
    * **Heroku** - my GitHub repo for this project had been connected to Heroku app to enable management and deployment of this app.

## Testing

The testing data for this project can be found in a separate file called [here](https://github.com/murthy1811/gangas_biryani/blob/master/TESTING.md).

### Issues and Solutions
* While adding the Reviews model, several issues popped due to the python code errors. Each error is fixed by carefully studying-
* Bootstrap classes implementation went hard in order to maintain the right flow
* Review page showed internal server error after deployment to heroku. Identified djago package error which I wrote into code and fixed
* Review page css fixed for all smaller screens to adjsut the page overall.


## Deployment

- #### **Requirements:**
    * **Python3** to write the code and run the application
    * **PIP** to install packages
    * **Git** for version control
    * **GitPod** powered by VS Code was used for this project (any IDE of your choice will work)
    * **Django** - to create the models
    * **Heroku** - to deploy and manage the app


### Project Creation

* This project was created using the CI recommended [Gitpod Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
* Click on **_Use this template_** button and enter a short and memorable name of your choice for your repo and select **_Create repository from template_**. 
* Once created, click on green **_Gitpod_** button to open your new workspace. 

 	1.  Log in to your  Gitpod account 
	2.  Clone this project repository from GitHub
    -   Go to my [Gangas_Biryani repository](https://github.com/murthy1811/gangas_biryani) 
 	3. Add Gitpod browser extension for Chrome:
    -   Go to  [GitPod Chrome Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki)
  	4.  If you  installed the extension you should view a green Gitpod button on the top right corner of page. Next to Clone or Download button. 
  	5. When clicked this button will allow you to open this repository directly in Gitpod.
	6.  The following environment variables needs to be set:

		KEY | VALUE
		------------- | ------------- | 
		DATABASE_URL | <DATABASE_URL>
		AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
		AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>

### Deployment to Heroku
Heroku cloud platform was used to deploy and host this app by following the steps below:

* **Set up workspace for Heroku:** 
    * In the terminal window of your IDE, create a requirements.txt file to contain all applications and dependencies required to run the app.

        ``` pip3 freeze --local . requirements.txt```
    * Create a Procfile (always with a capital P and no file extension!) - required by Heroku, to know which file runs the app.

        ``` echo web: python app.py > Procfile```

* **Create application in Heroku:**
    * Navigate to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) website and create an account.
    * Once logged in, click on the **_New_** button and select **_Create New App_**
    * Create a name for your app and select the region closest to your location.

* Now go back to Heroku and click on **_Enable Automatic Deployment_** and **_Deploy Branch_**.
